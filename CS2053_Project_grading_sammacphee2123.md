    Comments:  Requirements were met, minor issues with collisions (sometimes player would infinitely explode, boss clips through object, etc.)

2. 20%: gameplay balance/quality/depth

    Grade: 19
    Comments: Game difficulty progressed pretty well, except the second level was too easy. My main note is that the 3rd sword is less effective than throwing the 1st knife at projectiles.
